# zombie-server

A RESTful HTTP server for accessing Zombie.js sessions, the main target of this
library is when you want to plug zombie.js into a testing framework for a
language or development stack which is not NodeJS based. And to provide a clean
interface for interacting with zombie.js sessions.

This is a very early work in progress, and as such probably doesn't work yet.

## Goals

 * Clean RESTful interface supporting all Zombie.js features
 * Make it easy to consume said interface
